# autonomous_car
Autonomous miniature car that drives based on plates with numbers. Each number has a command associated with and the car recognizes the number (using a simple neural network trained with MNIST database) to know what should it do. The car system is based on a raspberry-pi, working as a server, and a local linux computer, working as a client.
